My experience switching to a minimalist Android dumbphone.

![CAT S22 Flip]()

Background-
======
About 6 months ago I came across a subreddit called `r/dumbphones`. All posts on the subreddit had a common theme of `Digital Minimalism`, intrigued by this I started doing some research. There is an increasing trend of people wanting to become `digital nomads` and this chiefly includes ditching their regular smartphones for minimalist dumbphones mainly to curb their phone addiction. This includes social media, texting etc. While I had stopped using Instragram and Snapchat a while back and enjoyed the benefits of getting off of those platforms, I found myself still addicted to my smartphone chiefly with texting my friends and YouTube. Given that this was around the same time I was going to start preparing for my GRE exam, where my phone addiction was becoming a hindrance, I thought it will be a good idea to consider switching and seeing if there were any benefits. Spoiler alert- best decision ever.

How did I select the phone?
======
I think it will be a good idea to start off with how I went about selecting the dumbphone, before discussing the pros and cons of switching, as it is often never covered by those who blog about switching to this lifestyle. I was doing a good amount of research and spending too much time reading too many conflicting opinions. Each of the popular choices for phones have entire lists of pros and cons for selecting the device. Instead I opted for a bottom-up approach. By bottom-up approach I mean rather than finding a phone that will be suitable by having to adjust my usage depending on the phone's abilities, I first wrote down exactly what my requirements were to then go about deciding the phone. 
My requirements were-
- phonecalls
- sms - for OTPs
- Whatsapp
- UPI
- worked with Airtel bands

Given that these were the basic requirements, it had to be an Android phone with Google Play features enabled (knocking off a lot of Japanese and Chinese phones). I wasn't even interested in actually using Whatsapp on the phone, rather to just be activated on a phone so I can link it to the web version and use it on my Desktop. The same goes for all delivery apps like Swiggy, Blinkit etc, I could use the web versions by logging in with OTPs sent via SMS. The main catch arguably was the availability of UPI payments, which I use on a daily basis for POS and merchant transactions.

So given these constraints, and using the Jose Brione's [Dumphone Finder](https://dumbphones.pory.app/), I decided on the CAT S22 Flip, given that it had all the features I was looking for, and an added advantage was the unlocked version was imported and sold by many Indian vendors.


Lifestyle Changes
======
Positive Impacts
-----
Starting off with the positive impacts, my phone addiction was curbed immediately. Given the low performance and small screen, it is extremely unappealing to use for anything other than absolute necessaties. I instead would use my desktop pc a lot more, which is a good thing, given that I had my pending work right in front of me, in this case was my GRE course and prep material. This coupled with the Youtube unhook extension meant that my YouTube addiction was completely stopped. I spent a lot less time replying to texts, having them collect over a small period and then bulk responding to them. This skewed to me only responding mainly to individual DMs, ignoring most of the group messages. While I originally wanted to stay in the loop and actively contributing to group messages, I realised that 90% of the topics being discussed while entertaining are totally irrelevant and the only real conversations that mattered were happening with individuals, not as a group. On a side note, it is much faster to respond to messages with a physical keyboard typing with all 10 fingers as opposed to a few fingers on the phone. Without the easy access to food delivery apps like Swiggy, I found myself ordering a lot less junk food.

## Note Taking
My original workflow consisted of using Emacs `orgmode` and Obsidian to take notes when I was at a Desktop or Laptop, and using my phone when I didn't have access to a desktop. I have now started using a physical notebook. The advantage I have noticed is how much easier it is to write out my thoughts in a structured manner using the physical space on the page. Also given how slow writing is compared to typing, I have to process my thoughts and only note down very important information, meaning I am understanding what I am writing. I couple this with my existing Emacs and Obsidian workflow. 

All in all this had a very positive impact on reducing my phone usage, indirectly on my health by making me order out less and becoming a more mindful notetaker. 

Negative Impacts
----
The negative impacts were mainly to do with how as a society it is normalized to have a smartphone and be reliant on it. I noticed this after starting work at a full-time job, so many of the processes like authentications, simple office polling etc were entirely reliant on me having a phone.
People have gotten used to the ad hoc nature of meetings and schedule them on the fly expecting people to be viewing their phone notifications to be alerted of the meetings. I had to adapt to this after the first day by checking my phone notifications as often as 10 minutes just to make sure I haven't missed any sudden unplanned meeting, a sort of pseudo addiction to the phone, where I am not wasting time but at the same time can't be independent of it either for hours at a time. Another negative impact I can see affecting others is a sort of lonely feeling you experience. I can see how being completely disconnected for hours at a time from social media and friends can cause some people to have issues. However, I can't guarantee this for others as I personally do not experience any negative effects from being disconnected for hours at a time.   

CAT S22 Flip Review-
======
This section is just my experience using the CAT S22 itself, nothing to do with using a dumbphone in general. 
pros-
- definitely one of the few phones you can use with least issues in India
	- most bands work, including airtel and Jio
- robust build, don't have to worry about damaging it
- touch screen
cons-
- physical
	- phone is bulky and heavy
	- the flip design is cool at first, but added with the bulky exterior, it becomes cumbersome to use on a regular basis and it is awkward to open it with one hand (maybe one hand is occupied holding a bus railing or something)
	- no headphone jack
	- no fast charging
- performance
	- very poor battery life, only 2000 mah, so can't rely on it for extended usage during the day
	- poor performance, while i am not trying to run anything too crazy, it is still very poor when it comes to basic tasks like whatsapp and chiefly the gpay upi app
	- the camera quality is a problem when it comes to scanning upi qr codes in poor lighting conditions, or during motion like on a bus
- software 
	- comes with a decent amount of bloat which needs to be removed
	- most apps work, however all my bank apps cannot be installed from google play because it is android 11 go edition, which isn't supported

Conclusion and Future-
======
In conclusion, this was one of the best decisions I have ever taken, and if possible I will continue to use dumbphones for the rest of my life. The pros of this lifestyle far outweigh the cons and I recommend everyone to shift to this kind of a lifestyle if feasible. At the very least, if not switching out the phone entirely, consider dumbing down a smartphone to do the bare minimum. I plan on purchasing the Xiaomi Qin F21 pro, given that it is a much sleeker phone and has all the pros of the cat s22 flip, without almost any of the flaws
