Building a binary image classifier from scratch and training it entirely in C.

Firstly, what is a Neural Network?
======
A neural network is a deep learning model in which an input passes through 'layers', while they get transformed by being multiplied with 'weights' and have 'biases' added to them. 'Layers' consist of 'nodes', which in turn contains the 'weights', so a layer can have multiple nodes depending on the required dimensionality we are working with.

The network can be trained to perform the required tasks by adjusting these weights, with the help of gradient descent and backward propogation. The basic idea being that with the training data, we will go through the network first and then make a backward sweep adjusting the weights depending on deviation of our prediction from the target output.

Why in C?
======
I have chosen C for the purpose of having as less of an abstraction as possible when it comes to implementing the network and training it with backward propogation, such as PyTorch or even using the numpy module. Along with the standard libraries, only an image processing library is being used(given that it is not the task at hand).

Binary Image Classifier 
======
The task chosen here is to build a binary image classifier, i.e a model that can classify whether an image belongs to one of two possible classes. The goal is to predict whether an image is that of a cat or a dog.
Dataset
------
The dataset chosen here is a set of labelled cat and dog images.
